    This generator is intended to generate a quick and handy framework with basic information about your application. It wont write the entire README for you (yet) but it will take out much of the design and guesswork as well as provide a basic style for everything. Using this app will eliminate much of the work that perviously needed to be done to write a useful and comprehensive README.
